# TuneBreeder

TuneBreeder is a collaborative platform where music evolves through an interactive evolutionary algorithm. Users can rate, mutate, and save melodiesâ€”contributing to a continuously evolving musical landscape.

## How It Works

- **Parallel Experiments:**  
  The system runs multiple evolution experiments in parallel, each starting with a set of randomly initialized musical genomes.

- **User Contributions:**  
  Users help evolve the melodies by:
  - Rating the melodies they hear.
  - Mutating selected genomes to alter the sound.
  - Saving their favorite melodies to their personal collection.

- **Evolutionary Process:**  
  When all genomes in a generation have been scored, the system applies evolutionary algorithms (using crossover between the top-scoring genomes) to generate a new generation. Over many generations, melodies become increasingly refined.

- **Final Composition:**  
  After a predetermined number of iterations (e.g., 1000 generations), the highest-scoring genome is preserved as a community-created composition.

## Project Structure

- **Frontend:**  
  A React application located in the `frontend/` directory.

- **Backend:**  
  A FastAPI server located in the `backend/` directory.

## Getting Started

### Backend Setup

1. **Navigate to the Backend Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
   ```bash
   # On Windows:
   venv\Scripts\activate

   # On macOS/Linux:
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

4. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Configure Environment Variables:**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and update the settings as needed.

6. **Run the Server:**
   ```bash
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   ```
   The API is available at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) and interactive documentation can be found at [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs).

### Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to the Frontend Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the Development Server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the application.
